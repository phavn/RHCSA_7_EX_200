##### AUTOFS #####

	- AutoFS mounts shares on demand when they are accessed. AutoFS works in user space so any user can use it.

	When using automount, you can use two different kinds of automount maps:
		- An indirect map contains a directory that should be created by automount.
		Indirect mounting allows for alteration without the need to restart the autofs
		service, which makes it completely accessible from user space.
		- A direct file does not involve creation of a directory, it has to exist before auto-
		mount can mount the (remote) file system


	- /etc/auto.master 		- Master map file that specifies local directory to mount shares to and mount config files location
	- /etc/auto.master.d 	- Individual map files can be created here. They have to end with .autofs  


	NFS Steps:
		- Create map file in /etc/auto.master.d
			# vi /etc/auto.master.d/nfs.autofs
		- Add content below
			- Indirect mount content
				/shares		/etc/auto.nfs
			- Direct mount content. It always starts with /-
				/-			/etc/auto_direct.nfs
			- Edit indirect config - /etc/auto.nfs. Notice that share directory (server1) has to be absent in /shares
					server1		-rw,sync 	server1:/home/nfsshare
				- Dynamic indirect directories entry:
					*			-rw,sync    server1:/home/ldap/&
			OR
			- Edit direct config - /etc/auto_direct.nfs. Notice that share directory has to exist on the client server
					/shares/server1		-rw,sync 	server1:/home/nfsshare

	SAMBA Steps:

		- autofs entries:
			/etc/auto.master.d/samba.autofs
				/mnt	/etc/auto.samba

			/etc/auto.samba 	Note: server path starts with ":"
				samba_share	-rw,fstype=cifs,username=user1,password=user1	://192.168.0.200/samba_share
