##### File system structure #####

	- node (contains file attributes, metadata of file, pointer structure)
	- file (can be considered a table with 2 columns, filename and its inode, inode points to the raw data blocks on the block device)
	- directory (just a special file, container for other filenames. It contains an array of filenames and inode numbers for each filename. Also it describes the relationship between parent and children.)

### Hard vs soft links ###

# Soft links
	- can cross the file system,
	- allows you to link between directories,
	- has different inodes number and file permissions than original file,
	- permissions will not be updated,
	- has only the path of the original file, not the contents.

# Hard links
	- can’t cross the file system boundaries,
	- can’t link directories,
	- has the same inode number and permissions of original file,
	- permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file,
	- has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed.
