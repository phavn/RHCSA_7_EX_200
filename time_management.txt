##### Time management #####

	- Hardware/rtc(real-time) clock
		When a Linux server boots, the hardware clock, also referred to as real-time clock,
		is read. This clock typically resides in the computer hardware. Generally, it is an
		integrated circuit on the system board that is completely independent of the current
		state of the operating system and keeps running even when the computer is shut
		down. From the hardware clock, the system gets its initial time setting.

   	- System clock
		System time is a time maintained by the operating system. Once the system has
		booted, the system clock is completely independent of the hardware clock. There-
		fore, when system time is changed, the new system time is not automatically syn-
		chronized with the hardware clock.
		System time is a time that is maintained by the operating system and it is kept in
		UTC. Applications running on the server are converting system time into local
		time. Local time is the actual time in the current time zone. In local time, daylight
		savings time (DST) is considered so that it always shows an accurate time for that
		system.


		- Show time information (system time, rtc, timezone etc.)
			# timedatectl
		- Show time zone (also located in /usr/share/zoneinfo/)
			# timedatectl list-timezones
		- Set time zone (sets softlink from /etc/locatime to /usr/share/zoneinfo/ zone file)
			# timedatectl set-timezone <time zone>
		- Set time
			# timedatectl set-time <time>

   	- NTP /Chrony - 
	   	
	   	# timedatectl set-ntp 1

	   	# chronyc tracking	- Skew time shows how much to speed up/delay system time as it's running slower/faster than the ntp source
	   	# chronyc sources -v
	   		- stratum - how far server is from its clock device source

	   	- Chronyd config file - https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/sect-understanding_chrony_and-its_configuration
	   		
	   		/etc/chrony.conf
	   			- rtcsync directive set to on by default. Tells chrony to sync RTC clock to system clock every 11 minutes
