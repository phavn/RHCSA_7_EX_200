##### Linux permissions #####

- Linux uses discretionary access control (DAC)

	Permission 		On a file 					On a directory
	 Read (r)     	     Perm to read 				 Perm to list content of directory
	 Write (w) 	     Perm to write/delete 			 Perm to delete files
	 Execute (x)         Perm to run 				 Perm to access content of files

	Permission 		On a file 					On a directory
	 SUID 			 Process inherits UID 	 			 No effect
	 SGID 			 Process inherits GID 		 		Files in directory inherit group ownership
	 Sticky bit (t)  N/A 						 	Files in directory can be renamed or removed only by their owners


    - Numeric permission mode:

		4 - Read (r)
		2 - Write (w)
		1 - Execute (x)

		4 - SUID
		2 - SGID
		1 - Sticky bit


# ACL

	# getfacl									- List ACL's

	# setfacl -m u:user1:rwx /path/to/file 			- Grant rwx to user1 on file
	# setfacl -x u:user1 /path/to/file 			- Revoke all user1 permissions from file

	# setfacl -m g:group1:rwx /path/to/file 		- Grant rwx to group1 on file
	# setfacl -x g:group1 /path/to/file 			- Revoke all group1 permissions from file

	# setfacl -b /path/to/files 				- Remove all file's ACLs


# Default ACL
	Directories can contain one or more default ACLs. 
	Default ACL is inherited by files created within the directory.

		# setfacl -d -m -u:user1:rw /path/to/dir/ 				- Grant user1 rw access on all new files in dir/

# ACL mask
	The mask associated with an ACL limits the permissions avaliable on a file for named users and groups and for the group owner

 		# setfacl -m mask:r-- /path/to/file 					- Only r permission can be granted to file
